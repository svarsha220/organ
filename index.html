                                    *   Every day, there are approximately 107,000 people on the waiting list nationally for an organ. </div>
        
                    <div>           *   People who are on an organ waiting list typically have end-stage organ disease that significantly impacts their quality of life and may be near the end of their life. Receiving an organ can become a life-changing event for these people. It can also help a family work through the grieving process and deal with their loss by knowing their loved one is helping save the lives of others.</div>
        
                    <div>          *   One organ donor has the potential to save eight lives.</div>
        
                    <div>          *   A living donor can donate a kidney or a portion of their liver to a friend or family member or even altruistically and continue to live a normal life with very little restrictions. People waiting for a kidney transplant make up more than 80 percent of people on the organ waiting list and people waiting for a liver transplant makeup approximately 12 percent.</div>
